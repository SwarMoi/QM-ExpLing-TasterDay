## Why Do We Need to Tidy Up Brainwaves?

::: incremental
-   The raw data from EEG is messy, kind of like a radio with lots of stations playing at once.
-   Preprocessing and analysis help us isolate the “songs” we want to hear from the brain.

## What Are We Tuning Into?

::: incremental
-   Brain cells (neurons) create tiny electrical signals when they talk to each other.
-   Taken together, clustered activities are connected to different things your brain does, like focusing, daydreaming, or sleeping.

# Preprocessing: Spring Cleaning for Brainwaves!

## 1. Removing Unwanted Signals

::: incremental
-   Sometimes we pick up other signals, like from your eyes blinking or muscles moving.
-   We use special tools to get rid of those extra noises.

## 2. Filtering

::: incremental
-   Imagine you want to listen to just the **Cello** in a song. [Filtering]{.underline} is like turning down all the other instruments.

## 2. Filtering

-   We do the same thing with EEG to focus on specific brainwave rhythms.

## 3. Making Sense of the Music

-   Watching the Waves.
    -   We can look at how the brainwaves change over time, like during a video game or when you’re solving a puzzle.

### 👩‍🔬 Research:

::: incremental
-   Scientists use EEG to learn about how we sleep, pay attention, remember things, and feel emotions.
-   It also helps us understand problems like epilepsy and how the brain changes as we get older.
-   In our lab, we investigate language processing in the Brain
